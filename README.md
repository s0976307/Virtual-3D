# Virtual-3D

In this project, I will create a virtual three dimensional display using face tracking for head tracking. More specifically, I use the HAAR Cascade face tracker from OpenCV to determine a persons x, y and z location relative to aa webcam. I then update the display of a virtual tunnel according to the users position so that it gives a 3D effect
